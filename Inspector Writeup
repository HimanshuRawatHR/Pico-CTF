Inspector Writeup 

Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we need to analyze a website to extract a hidden flag by inspecting its elements and searching through its CSS and JavaScript files.

Steps to Retrieve the Flag
Step 1: Inspecting the Website
1. Open the provided website link in your browser.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect (or press F12 to open Developer Tools).
3. Navigate to the Elements tab and expand the HTML structure.
4. Look for any hidden comments in the code.
5. A comment located below a </p> tag contains the first part of the flag. 


  
Step 2: Searching for More Flag Parts
1. In the Developer Tools, locate the Search Box (usually found in the top-right corner of the Elements or Sources panel).
2. Type and search for /mycss.css and /myjs.js.
3. Open these files to look for any hidden text, comments, or suspicious code.
4. The second and third parts of the flag can be found within these files.

Step 3: Combining the Flag
1. Collect all parts of the flag obtained from:
    * The HTML comment in the Elements tab.
    * The mycss.css file.
    * The myjs.js file.
2. Remove any / characters as they are not part of the flag.
3. Ensure there are no spaces between the segments.
4. Combine them to get the complete flag.  

Final Notes
* The flag follows a continuous format with no spaces.
* Be sure to check all file contents thoroughly, as CTF challenges often include obfuscation or encoding.
* If necessary, use the Network or Sources tab to analyze how files are loaded dynamically.
