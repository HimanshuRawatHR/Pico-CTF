CTF Writeup: Manipulating Cookies to Gain Admin Access
Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we are provided with a website that requires login credentials, which are given in the question. The goal is to manipulate the website’s cookies to obtain the flag.

Steps to Solve the Challenge
Step 1: Open the Website and Log In
1. Navigate to the given website.
2. Enter the provided username and password to log in.  
Step 2: Open Developer Tools (Inspect Element)
1. Right-click anywhere on the webpage and select Inspect.
2. Alternatively, you can open the Developer Tools by pressing F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac). 
3. ￼
  
Step 3: Navigate to Application Tab
1. In the Developer Tools panel, locate the Application tab.
2. Under the Storage section on the left panel, click on Cookies.
3. Click on the sub-option that appears under Cookies (this should correspond to the website's domain). 
4. ￼
 
Step 4: Modify the Admin Cookie
1. In the cookies list, look for an entry with the Name admin.
2. The Value for admin is set to False.
3. Double-click on the value and change it to True.
4. Press Enter to save the change. 
Step 5: Refresh the Page
1. After modifying the cookie, refresh the webpage.
2. If done correctly, the website should now reveal the flag.

Conclusion
By modifying the cookie value from False to True, we were able to elevate our privileges and access the flag. This highlights how poorly implemented authentication mechanisms relying solely on client-side cookies can be exploited. 
Key Takeaways:
* Web applications should not store or rely on security-critical values in easily modifiable client-side storage.
* Proper session management and server-side validation are necessary to prevent such vulnerabilities.
